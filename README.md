📒 The Cliff's Notes On Me 📒

I'm a Military Brat who has seen and lived in so many places people only get to see on TV or a globe 🌍. I completed my BA at Georgia State University in 2009 in Communications and since then, I've held roles in a lot of exciting industries, like Retail Management, Real Estate Investment and Trusts (REITS), Production and I even maintained my own E-Commerce portal for a time! COVID-19 forced many of us to ask ourselves really hard questions about what our futures looked like professionally, and after a bit of research and soul searching, here I am six months later, a Flatiron School Software Engineering Graduate and excited to make an impact as Software Engineer for years to come!
